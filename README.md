This is the source code and superpolies for the paper "Stretching Cube Attacks: Improved Methods to Recover Massive Superpolies".

Since the superpolies of 846-, 847- and 848-round Trivium and 192-round Grain-128AEAD are too large, we only provide codes in the "PaperCodes" folder. The folder "PaperSuperpoly" contains the superpolies of 895-round Kreyvium and 776-round Acorn.
